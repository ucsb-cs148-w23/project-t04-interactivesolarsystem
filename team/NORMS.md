# Norms:

1. Finish assignments in advance of the deadline
2. Help each other when blocked and continue working hard on our individual parts
3. Review team assignment instructions together so that everyone has good understandings.
4. Communicate roadblocks early
5. Post on slack often about individual progress and be honest about the progresses.
