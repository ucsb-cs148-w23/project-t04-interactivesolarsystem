## Stand up Meeting:


Elizabeth: Met with other team members, need to work on researching more technologies and gaining familiarity.

Dingfan: finished Lab 02 additions to readme

Ethan: Met with some other team members and added some stuff to the Kanban Board as starters, need to add more to freshen them up a little more

Aashay: Attended meeting over the weekend working on the Kanban board, will look into downloading unity and doing some tutorials.

Mason: Researched facts and data on the planets in the solar system as background for the app.

Richard: Researched technologies and how to host our application and found itch.io as a good option to deploy our unity app into the web so we only need to spend time on unity stuff
rather than the website part. next steps would be to collect more data and writing scripts and collect the materials for the components we are going to use in the application, find 
packages that contain existing shapes for the planets and use them in our unity planet to build the solar system.
