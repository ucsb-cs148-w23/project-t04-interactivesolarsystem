# Team-4-solar-system

## Project Name: Interactive Solar System
Tech stack: Unity, itch.io platform.

### Description: 
We aim to use graphical engine which will produce simulated views of planets in the solar system from any point in space. Our targeted users are likely to be students who are looking to learn more about the solar system or explore material beyond class level. Through this interactive experience, users would find it more interesting and easier to learn about the solar system.

### How to Install

UPDATE THIS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN DO IT, AT THE END, ADD A BUILD INTO THE REPO AND THEN REFERENCE IT HERE
In order to work on this project, you need to have the Unity Editor downloaded. From there you can open the app and edit things if you want. 

Then to upload to itch.io, you first need to create an account or gain access to our account. Then, open the project in the unity editor and click on file and then click on build in the drop-down menu. After the project is built, compress it and upload the .zip file to itch.io. Then you will be able to use the game through the itch.io site!

###Deploy to Public Host:

We use <a href="itch.io">itch.io<a> platform to host our unity-based project. <a href="itch.io">itch.io<a> is a easy-to-use platform that only requires build files to host Unity-based applications. After building our WebGL project in Unity, we zipped the build files and uploaded to <a href="itch.io">itch.io<a>. Here's the link to our deployment: https://team04-interactivesolarx.itch.io/team04-interactivesolarx
